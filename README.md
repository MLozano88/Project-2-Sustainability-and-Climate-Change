# Project-2-Sustainability-and-Climate-Change
This project focuses on Climate Change factors for the leading 20 countries CO2 Emissions from 2015. We analyzed world wide CO2 emissions, GDP, Renewable Energy (% to total energy), and Urban Population growth to see if there were any consistencies in these countries. Finally, we developed an interactive webpage at ______________.com which showcases a visual dashboard the user can view based on a country selector.
